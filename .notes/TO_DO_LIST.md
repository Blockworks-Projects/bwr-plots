In Progress
- Fix y-axis below 0 for time-series data with no negative values
- Fix Number of significant figures - we should never display the same y-axis label value twice (such as 0, 1, 1, 2, 2)
- Make sure Legend doesn't overlap the source
- Add multi-axis for scatterplot
- Add option for 'Index' to not display it as datetime
- for bar chart make it cycle through colors for each bar
- Make it so that you dont have to zoom out, there should be scroll bars

- Add Light Mode
- Add Table Feature

Waiting on Reid
- Add Background Gradient
